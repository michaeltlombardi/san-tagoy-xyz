# Nico's Dreaded Portfolio

## Marketing is insidious, which is why I made this site: partly for marketing myself.

I used to design games, now I write them. Am I a writer? I'd like to be one. I'd like to be many things, like a collage artist or a writer of Tabletop Role-playing Game *things*.

Besides writing, I designed a number of games: [**Letters of the Sky (2021)**](https://far-horizons-co-op.itch.io/sgd8) and [**The Moment Phantasm (2022)**](https://far-horizons-co-op.itch.io/anthology-2-1). Both epistolary games published in anthologies by The Far Horizons Cooperative.

On things I've actually written in the Tabletop RPG scene, there's [**Blessed Art Thou (2022)**](https://spearwitch.com/products/violence-collection) also published in an anthology.

Now this ***portfolio*** will serve as the medium by which I will tear down the barriers guarding the attention economy. Witness my progress from poor barely passable writing to actually competent works!

## Wait, what is Wanton Pinoy Spaghetti?

It's Spaghetti Westerns set in Spanish colonial Philippines. All this experienced through the medium of Tabletop RPGs. Imagination and conversation are the essential ingredients to play.
