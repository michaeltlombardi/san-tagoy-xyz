# Nico's Road to Better Writing

---

## Marketing is insidious, which is why I made this site: partly for marketing myself.

Besides writing, I designed a number of Tabletop games: [**Letters of the Sky (2021)**](https://far-horizons-co-op.itch.io/sgd8) and [**The Moment Phantasm (2022)**](https://far-horizons-co-op.itch.io/anthology-2-1). Both epistolary games published in anthologies by The Far Horizons Co-op.

As for other things I've written in the scene, there's [**Blessed Art Thou (2022)**](https://spearwitch.com/products/violence-collection) also published in an anthology.

This is my journey to better writing. A catalog of my progress and an outlet as some creative online.
