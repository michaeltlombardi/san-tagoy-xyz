# Road to Better Writing

---

## Marketing is insidious, which is why I made this site: partly for marketing myself.

I write things that are hopefully useful for people in the hobby. You can find my random entries in [BLOG POSTS](posts/_index.md).

I also have some system drafts here too like [Wanton Pinoy Spaghetti](games/wanton-pinoy-spaghetti/_index.md), my rules set for running adventures in Colonial Philippines. Adventures for it are coming soon.

There's also [Southern Skies](games/southern-skies/_index.md) which is my friend's OD&D clone re-written to suit more of my preferences. Finally, there's [Steel Typhoon Eon](games/steel-typhoon-eon/_index.md) an ongoing project that I hope to finish and eventually publish.

I also wrote for a few things like the [Violence Collection (2022)](https://magical-banquet-club.itch.io/violence-jam-fuck-war) and the biannual [Red Solstice Zine](https://redsolstice.itch.io/).
