## Surprise and Reaction
When monsters are encountered the referee gauges the foes' reaction and if there is surprise. Not all monsters would immediately attack, some may even be friendly and seek to act in mutual interest parlaying with characters. Surprising another allows them to take an action before the other acts. If there is mutual surprise, characters who keep their wits about them may act as if they had surprised the monster. Without surprise, actions are resolved simultaneously.  

## Running and Hiding

When the choice to flee is made by a character, monster morale is checked to see if they pursue. Normally, the faster party wins the pursuit: faster prey escaping while faster hunters catch their quarry.

If the prey and hunter move at the same speed, a prey could only escape by vanishing from a hunters sight. Once characters are out of sight, they have a high chance to hide themselves or lose those who chase them. This chance is adjusted favorable by precipitation or foliage and unfavorably by terrain which retains tracks or hunters with keen senses.

Those who would drop food once chased be animals would improve their chances of fleeing, distracting them with a meal. Likewise dropped treasure could distract men or monsters who pursue.

## Moving Silently

In certain circumstances, such as traveling in the underworld by torchlight or riding upon horseback one couldn't move silently. Otherwise, each character’s ability to move silently is noted on their sheet. Thieves are most skilled in this, however those who wear padded boots and forgo packs and satchels would move quieter. Those clad in heavier armor would find silent movement difficult. In a group, the member who is worst at moving silently, determines the groups ability.

## Combat

Combat is resolved simultaneously between characters and their foes in a series of phases: Movement, Missile, Melee, Misc., and Morale.

At the start of every round of combat (6 seconds), the caller relays the actions of each character to the referee in phase order and each phase is resolved simultaneously.

During a **Movement** phase, a character may move at a sixth of the distance they could move during an exploration turn.

During the **Missile** phase, a character may shoot an arrow or throw a missile, those who spent the previous round aiming receive a bonus to this attack. Missile attacks into melee risks striking an ally. Characters engaged who launch missiles are unable to score hits in the melee phase.

During the **Melee** phase, a character may attempt to trip, disarm, grapple, shove, or otherwise hamper a foe.

A successful hit (a total of 20 on the 1d20 + all modifiers) provides their companions with a greater chance of successfully striking the hit foe in melee. Failure, however, risks a reprisal hit from the same foe or another.

Alternatively, a character may choose to fight more defensively, trying to score a hit with less damage, without risk of taking damage on a failed hit.

Lastly, a character may declare they assist their companions, forgoing their melee action to improve a companion's chance of success.

During the **Misc** phase, resolve all other actions. If in a grapple, you can pin or attack again in melee. Once someone is pinned in a grapple, the victor may choose to exit the grapple or keep the loser pinned and helpless.

During the **Morale** phase, monsters and non-characters may have their morale tested to resist fleeing poor odds. Players decide if their characters flee.

## Turn Undead

Your holy symbol is anathema to undead hordes. Brandish it on high and claim your allegiance to your faith. Roll 2d6, the higher the result, the more likely you will turn the undead hordes.

## Violent Ends

Those unable to avoid violence from monsters and enemies fall unconscious and roll a save upon reaching 0 hp. Roll 1d6.

|  1d6   | Death Save Result                                    |
|:------:| ---------------------------------------------------- |
|   1    | Certain Death                                        |
|  2–4   | Dismemberment only                                   |
| 5 or 6 | Survives, but will bleed out without aid in 15 mins. |

An unconscious character must be carried by another, encumbering them as if they were carrying 2 full satchels.

## Recovery

A night’s (uninterrupted and at least as long as a quarter of a day) sleep recovers a character 1 HP, a day of bed rest heals 2hp. Those forgoing food or water don't heal.

## Duels

Fair combat between two individuals is resolved by rounds of bets, with both participants betting portions of their HP to a pool. Upon each bet, throw opposing 1d20's + Thews—higher roll wins, loser subtracts the whole pool from their total HP. These rounds of betting continue until one yields or an individual is reduced to 0 hp.

## Jousting [^1]

Jousts are knightly contests of mounted combat. A knight must possess armor, shield, helm, mount, and at least one lance to participate.

A joust is scored as the best of three tilts in which two mounted knights enter the lists and, separated by a barrier, make an unimpeded charge at one another with the objective of unhorsing the opponent. Each throws a single, simultaneous attack roll with additional modifiers depending on their mount: War-charging Horse +8, hunter horse +6, and riding or draft horse +2. On a hit throw two six-sided dice and consult the jousting table. For sport the lesser of the two dice indicates damage sustained; in war damage is the sum of both dice.

### Jousting Result Table

| 1-6 |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  1  |  G  |  G  |  G  |  G  |  G  | B+U |
|  2  |  G  |  G  |  G  |  B  |  B  |  U  |
|  3  |  G  |  G  |  B  |  B  |  B  |  U  |
|  4  |  G  |  B  |  B  |  B  |  B  |  U  |
|  5  |  G  |  B  |  B  |  B  |  B  |  U  |
|  6  | B+U |  U  |  U  |  U  |  U  | B+H |

- **G** Lance glances off opponent.
- **B** Lance broken upon opponent.
- **H** Opponent struck upon helmet.
- **U** Opponent unhorsed.

A glancing blow scores no points. Breaking a lance upon the opponent scores one point, or three points upon the opponent’s helmet. Unhorsing the opponent scores ten points. If a knight cannot continue due to injury he loses. The loser forfeits their mount or a grander wager by prior arrangement.

## Encumbrance

You have 6 quick slots, items that can be quickly grabbed at a moment's notice. These could be on your belt or on your back or tied to your backpack. Shields, spears, and heavy weapons could be carried in this manner.

Most items would take up a single inventory slot of space. 3 Light items such as a dagger, torch, or day’s food may be carried in a single inventory slot. Cumbersome items would require multiple inventory slots.

A backpack worn on one’s back would grant an additional 5 inventory slots. A satchel worn on one’s person would grant an additional 5 inventory slots. A character could wear two at once.
