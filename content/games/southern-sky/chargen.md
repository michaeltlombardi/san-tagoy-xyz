You play as young initiates of a free company of knights in a setting akin to the real Dark Ages. Think of a world with an Arthurian flair: grand castles, mighty moats, and Christian overtones. You are all beholden to a king who holds the seemingly divine right to rule over lands.

There are no fantasy races here. You are all some manner of human.

## Attributes

You have three Attributes:

- **Thews** — modifies to-hit rolls and damage rolls in melee combat
- **Wits** — determines when they can act in mutual surprise
- **Charisma** — adds to reaction rolls from NPCs

Roll 1d4 once per Attribute to determine the modifier of each.
