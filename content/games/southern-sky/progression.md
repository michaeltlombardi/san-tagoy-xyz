## Leveling Up

There are 10 levels. Every even-numbered level grants +1 Hit Dice (HD) to a maximum of 5 HD (each equal to 1d8).

Every odd-numbered level, choose a **Feat**.

{{< expand "Character Feats">}}
1. **Berserk:** Rage to gain +2 to Slaying, Saves, and Damage for one round as well as +2 HD temporarily for one encounter (the latter applies only once per encounter). Afterward, save or lose the ability for the day.
2. **The Grappler:** All attempts at grapples are made with +2. Additionally, if you are currently grappled, roll a Save. On a success, you counter the grapple.
3. **Great Fortitude:** Gain a +4 bonus to saves against poison, disease, and death.
4. **Iron Will:** Gain a +4 bonus to saves against mental attacks, including charm, fear, and illusions.
5. **Mounted Combat:** Gain +2 to hit and +4 damage with mounted melee attacks, and +4 to saves against being unhorsed.
6. **Rapid Shot:** Gain an extra attack every round in missile combat.
7. **Fortuitous Studies:** Come across a random ritual or candle recipe in your studies (can be taken multiple times).
8. **Sentinel:** While wielding a shield and in the front ranks, allies behind you gain +2 to their attacks against enemies you defend against.
9. **Toughness:** Add an extra +2 HP every time you gain HD.
10. **Tracking:** Track targets on a 4-in-6 chance basis, adjusted for small or large parties, inclement weather, and the like.
11. **Two Weapon Fighting:** Fight with a light weapon in the off hand, for either +2 Evasion, or an extra attack at –2 to hit each round.
12. **Weapon Specialization:** Gain +2 to hit and damage with one weapon type of choice.

Roll and add to your maximum HP.

You need Experience Points (XP) to level-up. Use them to buy the next level for your character.

Multiply every succeeding level by 300 to see the cost for its level-up. 600 XP for Level 2, 900 for Level 3, 1200 for Level 4, and so on and so forth until level 10 (for 3000 XP).
