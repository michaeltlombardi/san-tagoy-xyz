## Introduction

Be the Spaghetti Western anti-heroes of your dreams in the wild times that were 19th Century Spanish Colonial Philippines. Think of the original _Django_ (1966) or the famous _The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly_ (1966) but set during the tumultuous era of the Katipuneros, the novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, and Andres Bonifacio! Navigate the tenuous politics of an era either preceding or amidst revolution as wandering heroes.

Imagine an adventure where you're being paid to smuggle copies of Noli Me Tangere to subversive libraries and book clubs. Aiding Katipunero cells escape Spanish persecution? What about getting hired by Heneral Luna to sabotage American supply routes? You’ll be doing this via the medium of Tabletop RPGs. One player will take on the role of the Game Master (GM) who will generate the world, the flora, the fauna, and the people in it. The rest of those at the table will be the players who each inhabit a single character in the world; they will be the protagonists, for lack of a better word. The succeeding text will help you all achieve the goal of having adventures in a Spaghetti-Westernized Philippines from the 1870s onwards.

## What do I need to play?

If you plan to play online, I can provide sheets for you to tinker with on Role VTT! It lets you make custom sheets for whatever game you want. The link to the sheets for the game can be found [here](https://app.playrole.com/sheet-templates/6a3e15ad-wanton-pinoy-spaghetti/save).

For face-to-face games, pencils and paper are your friend. The character details can fit on any index card. I'm still making official sheets for the game at the moment so stay tuned for those!
