## Initiative

Roll a d20 for each individual or group involved in the combat. Write these down and resolve, highest first.

Do this at the beginning of each Round. A Round is an innumerably fast amount of time. A single moment between life and death.

If you've caught your opponents by surprise, you all shoot first and resolve Initiative after the players' turns.

> Groups can be used for larger scale actions involving, for example, 3-4 bands per “side” of a conflict.

## Shooting

To shoot someone, anyone, in a gunfight, roll 16+ on a d20. If they are not in cover or moving, roll with Advantage. If firing multiple shots, add +1 per additional shot. Add relevant Tags. Resolve who gets shot: player chooses or we roll randomly.

If you've shot someone, roll another d20:

- Add +2 to the roll for each Injury they have.

- Revolver calibers add +2 to this roll.

- Hunting rounds, military calibers, and shotgun slugs add +4 to this roll.

- Buckshot adds +5 at close ranges and +2 at medium.

If the result is 10+, they go Down. Otherwise, they are Injured.

## Down

After the violence is concluded, roll a d20 for each person Down. Add +2 for each Injury. On a 10+, they are dead. Otherwise, they are Critically Injured and will die without medical attention.

## Sniping

To snipe, you must be at a distance. The target must also be unaware of your position and be either not in cover or not moving. To hit, roll 12+ with Advantage and add relevant Tags.

On a hit, roll for if they are Downed or Injured.

## Melee

Both combatants roll a d12 and add relevant modifiers. Pronounce if intent is to subdue or to kill.

- If the difference between them is 1 or 0, both are Injured and the fight continues.

- If the difference is 2-3, the high-scorer is Injured. The low-scorer is Injured and goes Down.

- If the difference is 4+, the low-scored is Injured and goes Down.

A sword, axe, spear, or other weapon that increases your reach would add +3. A shorter ranged weapon adds +2. Relevant Tags add +2 as always.

If Melee is initiated during a round, both combatants have their turns consumed until one goes Down.

## Suppression

When firing to suppress, no roll is required.

When a suppressed target attempts to take an action which could expose them, roll 1d6. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number of people firing to suppress, the target is shot. The number rolled is how many individuals hit—resolve each separately, determining randomly who hits.

If Suppression is at hidden or obscured targets, it only has half effect (i.e. 2 people would have to fire to have a 1-in-6 chance of shooting individuals as they take action.)

## Reloading

Account for every shot. Revolvers usually have 6 shots. Lever-actions, about 7-9 on average, more rounds makes for a longer gun. Reloading takes a round.

Coach guns only fire two shots. Single-shot rifle, only one shot of course. Bolt-action rifles? 5 shots. Anything with the `quick reload` Tag can be reloaded freely once per round after firing to be fired again.

An example would be the coach gun being able to fire 4 shots in a single round or a revolver with a speed loader can fire 12 rounds total before spending one round to reload.

## Healing

When you take an Injury and happen to survive a violent encounter due to someone's intervention, you must spend a week resting in a safe place per injury to heal. 3 injuries means 3 weeks for example.

After 3 days of receiving injuries, you may move around and act in some handicapped capacity. You will, however, retain those injuries until you heal.
