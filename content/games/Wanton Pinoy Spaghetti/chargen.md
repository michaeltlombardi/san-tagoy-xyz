Think of a character concept. Who are they in this time in history? A foreigner? A local? Regardless, they (and now by extension you) are in consistent company with a group of companions.

These companions are the other players (their characters) at the table. Think of how you all know each other in the world. Why are you as thick as thieves? Are you thieves?

How many languages do you know? Can't decide? Roll a 1d4 and that's how many languages you know. A number of the common languages of the time were the following:

- Bisaya
- Ilonggo
- Kapampangan
- Tagalog
- British English
- Cantonese
- French
- Spanish

## The Numbers

Now roll 1d4 for each of the three named Tag categories below. Whatever the result for each is how many starting Tags you get per category. Each Tag adds a +2 to a 1d20 roll.

You only roll a 1d20 when doing something risky like shooting someone in a firefight or trying to pick a lock under duress. The number you need to beat is often a 10-12 and (optionally) a 16+ in combat.

Sometimes, you roll with Advantage or Disadvantage which is rolling two d20s and taking the highest or lowest respectively.

Apply multiple Tags to a single roll if applicable.

## Inventory

You have 12 Inventory slots. First 6 are quick slots, anything you can pull out at a moment's notice. The next 6 require a d8 roll higher than the item's number slot to be procured immediately under duress, otherwise the item takes 10 seconds or more to find.

### Starting Loadout

All players start with the following:

- Revolver **or** Rifle (single-shot or lever-action)
- 1 Slot of appropriate ammunition
- Leather Rucksack
- a Hunting Knife **or** *Balisong*
- 3 days worth of rations
- Water Canteen
- 50 Pesos to buy miscellaneous [items](https://san-tagoy.xyz/games/wanton-pinoy-spaghetti/gear/) or to keep
- The clothes on your back

## Luck

Every time you fail a roll, mark Luck to a maximum of 5.

Avoid consequences by testing Luck. To succeed, roll at or lower than your current Luck on a d6.

Regardless of the result, remove a point of Luck every time you test it.

If you're **Lucky** then your Luck can't go lower than 1.

## Renown

On your character sheets you just have a brief punchy statement about your reputation. You're a myth in the making.
