Sleep while wearing armor is impossible and further donning armor takes considerable time, enough that if a camp is ambushed it is likely impossible to do so before combat begins. A character rising from sleep can arm themselves with two of the following within a single combat round a weapon, a quiver, a helm, or a shield.

A character **fighting unarmed** deals their Thews modifier in damage with a successful attack.

**Thrown weapons** deal 1d6 only in damage, but **thrown spears** add their wielderâ€™s Thews modifier to damage. With exception to daggers, thrown weapons have a range of 20m indoors and 30m outdoors. Daggers may be thrown up to 10m.

- **Grease** wards off water and lubricates objects, allowing things to slip.
- **Hide Glue** is an easily made adhesive along with **Pitch**.

**Foodstuff** is a day's worth of raw food for cooking over fire in a pot. The price depends on the relative rarity of ingredients.

## Flora and Medicine

May be bought from an apothecary or Witch for varying prices, availability subject to seasons and geography. These are foraged in the wilderness and crafted with time.

**Ephedra Tincture** is able to rouse a man from unconsciousness or end paralysis.

**Aglofotis** is able to be rubbed into a wound to counter act the effects of venom or purify imbibed poison.

**Monkshood** is a possibly sub-lethal poison which if swallowed cools the flesh, slows the pulse and breathing to near imperceptible levels allowing the imbiber to mimic being death. Frail men risk death upon imbibing it.

**Nightshade** is a poison potent enough to kill a horse if swallowed or kill a man when smeared on a weapon or arrowhead.

**Deathsbane** wards off death, allowing those who imbibe it to ignore wounds and fatigue.

**A tincture brewed from three deathsbane** would let a disemboweled man to fight on.

Beasts of Burden require 4x as much water and 2x as much food as a man. Camels can forgo both for 2 weeks.

|  Sack  |  12s  | takes up 10 slots, holds 20 slots inside |

## Vessels

The prices for these vary wildly depending on the quality of the ship, the type of wood used, the reputation of the guild craftsman, and many other reasons!

**Water Vessels** are able to travel across four horizons per day at sea or down-river and two horizons per day up-river.

**Fishing Boats** can be sailed by a single man or rowed by two men, and are able to carry a total of 5 men.

**Small Ships** can be sailed by a five man crew or rowed by ten men, and are able to carry a total of 25 men.

**Large Ships** can be sailed by a ten man crew or rowed by twenty men, and are able to carry a total of 50 men.

## Hiring Men

Men are hired for a minimum of a month of service, requiring payment upfront.

**Workers** require 5 silver a week.

**Mercenaries** require 10 silver per week.

Double these payments if hired men go into danger or if housing and food would not be provided. Mercenaries expect spoils of war and additional payment if they would lead a charge. The capacity of hired men to endure unreasonable demands is determined by their morale.
