title: 1d2 Heretical Troika Backgrounds
---

Troika backgrounds with a blasphemous flair in an acid west kind of place. This isn't the frontier, no. Think more of the colonies and a growing amount of ***spite*** against the institutions of beliefs and the people granted absolute power by that system.

I'll release more things like this in the future.

# Character Creation

1. Choose a Background from the five below! You are with everything they already have and even may have.
2. Roll 1d4+3 for Skill.
3. Roll 2d6+12 for Stamina.
4. Roll 1d6+6 for Luck.
5. Record Baseline Possessions that every new character starts with:Â *d66 silver, a big iron on your hip, 24 revolver bullets, a knife, flint & steel, a rucksack, 10 days worth of rations.*

# The Backgrounds

## 1 Reformed Church-goer

Once an avid connoisseur of imagined paradises in post-death immortality and belligerent denier of earthly delights. Now, you would rather imagine yourself burning down under (not Oseanya). Speaking of burning, the Inquisition persists in their hunt. Unfortunately for them, retribution is a two-way street.

Possessions:

- 5 empty wine bottles
- 3.5 liters of a homemade flammable substance
- 5 dry rags
- a bullet-stopping holy book

Advanced Skills & Spells:
3 Sneak
2 Spell - Assassin's Dagger
2 Chemistry
2 Medicine
2 Pistol Fighting
1 Athletics

## 2 Secular Survivor

The Greater Church's forces were zealously thorough in the systemic culling of all native people of the cloth. Nationalism? Independence? Perish the thought. Yet you remain among the inheritors' of your fallen brothers' will. Doubtful, however, that their will includes contracts with a false idol, some otherworldly conceptual existence from beyond.

Possessions:

- heretical ritual sickle *(with a groove for poisons)*
- symbolic carpenter's hammer
- tattoo of eldritch agreement

Advanced Skills & Spells:
4 Healing
3 Language (a dead one)
3 Spell - Read Entrails
1 Language (a forbidden one)
1 Sickle Fighting

Special:
In exchange for eternal servitude post-vengeance, you have a pact with a powerful, unfathomable entity. The corruption has warped your body: your blood is now Faithsbane and poisons any believer or clergyman from *that* Church. Additionally, there is a 2-in-6 chance you begin with 1 random mutation:

| 1d6 | Mutation                                                      |
|:---:| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | crab claw in lieu of a hand                                   |
|  2  | infravision eyes, the pupils are black slits on yellow irises |
|  3  | powerful, inverted legs like that of a predator               |
|  4  | an extremely prehensile monkey tail                           |
|  5  | bat wings that grant gliding but not flying                   |
|  6  | sharp un-retractable claws on all extremities                 |
