All guns in this new age operate on Mass Acceleration technology. These arms launch grain-sized particles at supersonic speeds. Ammo comes cheaply, any kind of heavy metal dust should work. Standardized MA batteryies only allow for a limited number of shots depending on the gun and require charging. 10 mins to bring a single battery to full charge.
