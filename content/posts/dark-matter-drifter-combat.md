Please check out Night-Tripper by Chris P. Wolf! You can find the original rules for Skirmishes [here](https://www.night-tripper.fun/chapters/rules-for-play/skirmishes/). Night-tripper as a whole is just really cool and was a major inspiration for Dark Matter Drifter!

# When do I use this?

Single rolls or just saying what happens are often enough to resolve most conflicts. For more complex scenarios, use these combat rules.

## Rounds

Combat is divided into rounds. Each round being a flash of time. Each character commits to only one action per round. Resolve actions in the following order:

1. Movement and/or Shooting
2. Melee
3. Miscellaneous

Talking is indeed a free action, but verbosity consumes an action. Players may decide their action as each actions are called out and resolved. All characters commiting to the same action perform it simultaneously.

## Attacks and Damage

Outside of combat, resolution is done with 1d20. During combat, use 2d6. Roll 2d6 + relevant Skills. If the target is 8 or higher, the attack hits. The lower die result determines hit location while the higher is the damage dealt.

| Lower Attack Die | Location |
| :--------------: | :------: |
|       1--2       |   Leg    |
|        3         |   Arm    |
|       4--5       |  Torso   |
|        6         |   Head   |

Once the combined total of damage taken is 5 or greater, the target is out of combat. They need medical intervention to survive.

Should damage in any of the hit locations reach 5 or greater, consult the following:

- Head: instant death.
- Torso: mortal wound. Death in 1d4 hours without stabilizing medical attention.
- Legs or arms: A limb is destroyed. Throw! Heads for the right, tails for the left.

Use luck to reduce the damage of incoming attacks tooâ€”1 point of luck to 1 point of damage. Attacks reduced to 0 this way are avoided completely.

Replace armor once it prevents its maximum number of hits in an intended location. The cost for such is listed in [Gear](dark-matter-drifter-gear.md). Armor instantly breaks when hit by anti-materiel rifles, plasma casters, and heavy artillery.

If you're hit by a projectile while wearing intact armor, lose your turn next round as you are forced to hunker down and catch your breathe.

## Tracking Ammo

You're assumed to have replenished the projectiles and recharged batteries during rest (if possible) or back at your ship. Track each shot before changing to a new battery cell.

Automatic weapons, guns with selective fire, have greater power draw when firing in bursts, but greater chance to hit and damage. Consume 4 shots, but roll with Advantage and add +1d6. However, roll with Disadvantage if you fire an Automatic weapon without the Shooting Skill.

## Character Actions

### Movement and/or Shooting

You can run (hopefully to cover) 10 meters over open ground. Obstacles or impeding terrain half that to 5 meters.

Or shoot targets within range, even if they're moving. Advantage is rolling 3d6 and taking the two highest. Disadvantage is rolling 3d6 and taking the two lowest. Shooting beyond the maximum range is a guaranteed miss.

Weapons that add to damage must roll +1d6 after the attack hits.

#### Weapon Range Limits

| Weapon              | Short Range (10m) | Medium Range (30m) | Long Range (200m) | Distant Range (1km) |
| ------------------- | :---------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: | :-----------------: |
| Pistol              |      Normal       |    Disadvantage    |       Miss        |        Miss         |
| Snub Scattergun     |      Normal       |    Disadvantage    |       Miss        |        Miss         |
| Scattergun          |     Advantage     |       Normal       |       Miss        |        Miss         |
| Mare's Leg          |     Advantage     |       Normal       |   Disadvantage    |        Miss         |
| Submachine Gun      |     Advantage     |       Normal       |       Miss        |        Miss         |
| Assault Rifle       |      Normal       |       Normal       |      Normal       |    Disadvantage     |
| Sniper Rifle        |   Disadvantage    |    Disadvantage    |     Advantage     |       Normal        |
| Anti-Materiel Rifle |   Disadvantage    |    Disadvantage    |      Normal       |      Advantage      |
| Plasma Caster       |      Normal       |       Normal       |      Normal       |    Disadvantage     |

#### Cover and Movement

Roll with Disadvantage against moving targets or those in cover. If you have Advantage due to range bonuses, roll normally.

Roll with Advantage against still targets our of cover. If you have Disadvantage against those same targets due to range penalties, roll normally.

If shooting while moving, roll with Disadvantage.

If you forego shooting while in cover and don't aim, you are considered hunkered down and out of line of sight.

### Melee

Melee is simultaneous. Fighters with short weapons are only at an Advantage against those unarmed and have Disadvantage against weapons with reach. Medium weapons (e.g. clubs and swords) are at a Disadvantage against longer-reaching weapons (e.g spears and other polearms).

### Miscellaneous

Operate machinery, drive a vehicle, perform first aid on someone seriously wounded, or aim. If you aim, roll with Advantage when you shoot next round.
