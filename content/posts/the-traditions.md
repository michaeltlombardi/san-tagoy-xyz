title: A Magic Thing! The Traditions 1
summary: |
  A small spell list with blessed undead and other spirits. It's meant to be expanded upon as part of a larger setting when I get to it.

  This indeed uses Luke Gearing's Wolves upon the Coast.

# The Traditions?

As many as there are Spheres of Afterlife. Every Tradition draws from a Sphere or multiple. No, you can't travel to these Spheres at the moment, at least while alive. Yes, many have tried and died—their attempts done while high on vanity. You must not succumb to such temptations. I pass this knowledge unto you with that hope alone. You've trained enough to perceive the veil and, while more training is required to manipulate it adeptly, I trust that these Spells are well within your power to enact.

## Undeadery

I reiterate that you are a medium of the Spirits to enact change, in all its forms, onto the world. Without you, they cannot exist or influence the world as we know it and without them neither can you. The Slaven Empire classifies all Undeadery as Necromancy and outlaws it. Be careful when entering their territories.

## Animate Dead

Corpses (even fleshcrafted ones) are possessed by Swarm Demons and re-animated to do Keepers' bidding. These Swarms only ever wanted a home and that's among their only bargains for the Pact. They stipulate too that they can't harm those undeserving and alive. The Swarms vary in size but they require your body as a temporary home while waiting for a corpse to sojourn in.

## Fleshcraft

Form a minor Pact with a Somatic Demon of Infernus to warp corpses or your own body into different shapes at your will and touch. The Pact demands the punishment of evil, even your evil, to use this spell. The demon rends your original skin and replaces the cover with itself as the facsimile. Mending another life's body requires the act to be of mercy and kindness. Malicious use of the power immediately ends the Pact—your skin forfeit.

## Sanctify the Lingering Soul

Restless Ghosts run amok if left unchecked. Hauntings are egregiously common in the Slaven Empire due to the loss of Undeadery—their "Exorcisms", vile. To appease the Soul, you must placate then communicate with them to learn the source of their anger. If the wrong done onto the Soul is within your power to correct then direct the spirit to the local Psychopomp for their final journey.

If the injustice isn't within your power to correct then you must connect with the local Psychopomp of the area to co-negotiate the Spirit to rest. At times, however, the restless spirit was a malevolent person in life and continues to be such in death. This requires you to forcibly tear the Veil with your implement and wrangle the Soul into the Twilight with or without the help of a Psychopomp. Guard yourself as they have a proclivity to possessions. Your body as a Keeper is a powerful vessel they can wreak havoc with if you are careless.

The rites for these sanctifications vary from Keeper to Keeper. A temporary bargain, a promise of a favor, the incurring of debts, with a Psychopomp are prerequisites for aid.

_Make a +3 Warding Save when a Ghost attempts to possess you. Failure means losing yourself for a fair amount of time. You may repeat the save every minute the Ghost remains in your body._

## Speak to the Dead Beyond

Commune with a local Psychopomp in front of a brazier. You require a pre-existing bargain with the area's Ferryman or an effigy honoring the Sphere of Twilight Purgatory made from precious metals. Offer the deceased's body (what's left of it) or an item significant to them. As it's reduced to ash in the flames, the Dead hears your call. If they do not consent to speak with you, the Spell fails.
