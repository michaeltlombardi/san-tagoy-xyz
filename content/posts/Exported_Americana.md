> "War. War never changes."
— Ron Perlman, Fallout intros.

In the year 2050, the extraction of wealth from the former colonies, or "enclaves of the free world", proved beneficial to the American War Machine. The Philippines, in particular, was a fattened cow whose wealth and value poured from its slit throat. Only a select (arbitrary) few could reap the benefits of the conquering of their fellow countrymen. It may have been at the cost of their already diminished dignity, but a barely extant conscience is a great abettor. The American Dream needed its enforcers.

This hierarchy was a house of cards needing only a gentle breeze for collapse. What was divinely delivered instead was the typhoon of global nuclear annihilation.

## Welcome to the Kapitol Wastes!

Over hundreds of years since the bombs fell. Humanity persists.

# 1 – Manila Jai Alai Building

It withstood the second Great War and it went on to survive the commercial whims of local government officials who'd have preferred it be replaced by another mall. Now it is home to the ***Blazing Bakunawas***.

This mercenary clan has eschewed the use of firearms in their code of honor and fight only with a miscellany of trick projectiles launched with their cesta baskets. Studded *pelotas*, impact grenades (colloquially known as pillboxes), and even hallucinatory liquids packed in balloons are all launched at targets.

They're in high demand across the Wastes and are famously among the toughest of Mercenary clans.

## 1.1 – What They Need

Chief Arthur Henares needs to make contact with their allies at Z-Soda Park. The latter have gone silent which is unusual considering their mutual closeness as allies and friends. The Bakunawas sent a party to offer aid a few days ago, but they were rebuffed by their leader Andres himself who would not give more details on the situation.

They will pay handsomely for a resolution and may be inclined to teach you a trick or two with their cestas.

50% chance that an emissary from the UDRF arrives at the Jai Alai building. The republican faction are keen on recruiting the Bakunawas in their war against the Huks.

# 2 – Z-Soda Museum

A "living museum" meant to both celebrate Filipino History within a reality-warping lens. Z-Soda, the preeminent beverage of the free world, and the Corporation that ruled the industry and its markets had a prominent role in the continued colonization of the country. Unions? Perish the thought!

"Z-Soda. It's Zuper!" was the famous tagline that etched itself into the brains of every single soul across the free world.

The symbol of their eternal place in the public consciousness of the Philippines was Z-Soda Park. Now, however, it's a hollowed out ruin inhabited by a number of robots turned sentient. ***Protocol Katipunan*** are what they call themselves as their leader believes itself to be possessed by the spirit of Andres Bonifacio.

They've poached the mechanisms of several attractions to create laboratories for producing various recreational drugs and hallucinogens to provide to the Kapitol Wastes. They also send out search parties to hunt for scrap for unit maintenance and laboratory maintenance.

They're allied to the Blazing Bakunawas. Either go out of their way to protect the other.

## 2.1 – What's troubling them?

They locked down their facility with no bots seen leaving the area as of late. The Blazing Bakunawas are rightly worried, but any sort of aid was promptly rebuffed by the Katipuneros. Andres, their leader, knows the Bakunawas don't have the capacity to solve the Katipuneros' predicament.

The reason for the lockdown is due to a spree of three murders by a serial killer robot amongst the Katipuneros. It won't stop until every robot in the facility is destroyed. Flesh targets are next once it leaves the facility.

## 2.2 – Killer's Modus Operandi

The entire facility goes dark as all CCTV footage corrupts. An EMP Shock disables the victims after which their identity matrices are cleanly extracted. A note written in cursive is at every crime scene taunting the robots to catch the killer.

## 2.3 – Area Map

### 2.3.1 – Ground Level

A high-ceiling hall with clues of a café rest collapsed in one of the corners. When facing the stairs, a large grid of windows provides on with a view of Manila Bay and Roxas Boulevard. The neo-classical architecture hint at grandness. All lost in the noise of war.

![custom map](/images/export-americana/Z-Soda-GroundFloor.png "Z-Soda Museum Ground Floor")

#### 2.3.1.1 – ENTRANCE

A grand stairway tapers off to the tall doors of Z-Soda Museum. "Z-Soda. It's Zuper!" is etched in a brass sign above the auxiliary inner doors.

#### 2.3.1.2 – CONCIERGE

Flanked by two menacing turrets. All who enter are greeted by three red K's flashed on a large screen and a chipper voice: "Greetings! We, the Katipuneros of this great land need you to state your purpose. Bear only the truth and good intentions lest you be vaporized by our Zap Turrets!"

The leader, the robot named Andres Bonifacio, greets visitors personally.

#### 2.3.1.3 – GRAND ATRIUM

An imposingly high ceiling with a dusty chandelier made of Z-Soda Green Bottles hanging in the center. Every square on the map is an auto-laser turret that blasts all hostiles into dust. Various Z-Soda memorabilia, photographs, and paintings mark the walls.

An even larger staircase than the one outside leads further into the museum, but is blocked by am immense steel hatch. The mechanism for opening it is elsewhere.

### 2.3.2 – Lower Ground Level

Once the grand exhibit room for Z-Soda Museum. They're history as a company and their endeavors in the country were all documented here at one point. Now here: The worn-away wallpaper, manufactured to have a texture akin to Z-Soda cans, bear a paisley pattern of fractal Z's. Scattered between *7a* and *7b* are animatronic polar bears and a cold skeleton of what was once a Santa Claus. A faint smell of burnt cables pervades.

![custom map](/images/export-americana/Z-Soda-Basement1.png "Z-Soda Museum Basement 1")

#### 2.3.2.1 – GENERAL ASSEMBLY HALL

A vast array of CRT screens blast the logo of Protocol Katipunan as a light-volumed national anthem plays in the background. The niches of the walls house metal scrap busts modeled after the famous Katipuneros of yore from Luna to Mabini. It is currently off-limits to all but the inner circle of robot Andres Bonifacio as it was the site of the first murder.

#### 2.3.2.2 – ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE

Andres Bonifacio's private office where he commonly hosts meetings with his inner circle. Religiously adorned with anything evoking nationalism with an old-fashioned, sturdy slab of constructed wood meant to be an executive desk in the center adjacent to the door. No one else can enter the office unless Andres is already inside.

#### 2.3.2.3 – EXHIBIT HALL

Once meant to be an ambitiously designed display of the company's timeline from its inception until what was the relative present at the time of construction. The early 20th century comprised most of what was the timeline.

Now it serves as storage for spare parts.

#### 2.3.2.4 – REPAIR STATIONS

These were once the designated location of the animatronic polar bear and Santa Claus attractions. Now they're where the Katipuneros repair and maintain themselves. Also here are entrances/exits to the loading-receiving stations outside of the museum.

#### 2.3.2.5 – GENERAL HALL

Robot Katipuneros off-duty roam the hallways and converse with one another.

#### 2.3.2.6 – ELEVATOR

The sole entrance/exit to the Basement level below.

### 2.3.3 – Basement 1

Where the magic (i.e. the vast amount of non-addictive narcotics in the Kapitol Wasteland) happens. Various automated mechanical arms and mannequins set about their tasks 24/7 to fuel the demand. Clearly every single mechanism here originates from somewhere in the museum or in the nearby amusement park. However, These don't appear jury-rigged in the slightest, in fact, everything here is precision machined. A gas mask for organics is required before entry due to the chemical fumes.

![custom map](/images/export-americana/Z-Soda-Basement2.png "Z-Soda Museum Basement 2")

#### 2.3.3.1 – FORMERLY THE EMPLOYEE BATHROOM

Now it houses the cleaning chemicals for the factory, separated from the production chemicals in **Room 13.**

#### 2.3.3.2 – MANUFACTURING HALL

Katipuneros on duty here frequently perform routine check-ups on the machines, resupply the chemicals for automated synthesis, and monitor the status of the mainframe.

#### 2.3.3.3 – THE MAINFRAME

One of the most important rooms in the Museum. All of the automation within the building is managed by the mainframe. This includes the lights, the production machines, and the CCTV footage. Only Andres Bonifacio and Santiago Alvarez should have remote access to the server and only he has executive privileges and control of the turrets. The Inner Circle should only have limited permissions in the Mainframe and must be physically present for access.

#### 2.3.3.4 – CHEMICAL STORAGE

Stored here are the entirety of the chemicals needed for narcotic production. A fire in this area would be catastrophic.

## 2.4 – The Personnel

### 2.4.1 – Andres Bonifacio

Once a sturdy lumber drone built for all-terrains, now he's a deadly dervish with the chainsaw on his left. After gaining sentience, he seized control of the Katipuneros by destroying the hibernating robot resurrection of Emilio Aguinaldo. He will lay down his life to see the end of this Serial Killer crisis.

### 2.4.2 – Antonio Luna.

Second-in-command and fiercely loyal to Andres. He was once a fencing automaton until he met Andres. The primary liaison with the Blazing Bakunawas. Together, their fiery temperaments and bold stratagems inspire many. He has yet to reboot his operating system since he discovered the first victim. He perpetually patrols the Museum with his guard never let down.

### 2.4.3 – Apolinario Mabini.

Primary adviser to Andres and council wisdom to the Katipuneros as a whole. He was first to propose the lockdown upon the discovery of the first victim. A robot model series built as a personal assistant to generals before the Great War.

### 2.4.4 – Gregorio Del Pilar.

The same robot model series as Apolinario, but with an additional fencing protocol. Found in the same junkyard together with Jose Rizal. They have been brothers for eternity since before the Great War.

### 2.4.5 – Jose Rizal

A factory bug resulted in the uploading of two personalities in the combat medic robot: that of Jose Rizal and Jack the Ripper. The latter had yet to boot properly and laid dormant for centuries. An accident that damaged his chassis during a routine scavenging mission resulting in a dual-boot of both personalities.

As a combat medic robot he has EMP shielding and fine mechanical motors for writing and surgery. He has hidden the identity matrices of his victims in plain sight at the bottom of the pile of spare parts in the Exhibit Hall. He was also able to gain mainframe access by surreptitiously hacking Santiago Alvarez.

He is aware of the routine patrols of Luna and actively avoids him during his hunts.

### 2.4.6 – Julian Felipe

Part of a bespoke robot pair built for conducting orchestras. Since gaining sentience, he has learned how to compose his own music. He is the newest of the Katipuneros and is becoming fast friends with the charming Jose Rizal.

### 2.4.7 – Julio Nakpil

The second to the orchestral conductor pair. He was once owned by a descendant of General Douglas McArthur before the Great War. He was once aiming to be a close adviser to the destroyed Emilio Aguinaldo. His loyalty to the current leadership is ambivalent.

### 2.4.8 – Mariano Alvarez

Ideally, the next victim of Jose Rizal. As a robot model designed as a military sentry, he closely patrols the Museum with Antonio Luna.

### 2.4.9 – Pia del Pilar

The "sister" of the now resurrected patriot. She is a newer prototype of Teresa Magbanua's combat model. She helps as supervisor of the automated narcotic production lines.

### 2.4.10 – Santiago Alvarez

As a teacher substitute model, he reads and writes at ludicrous speeds. His processing capabilities makes him fit to manage the museum's mainframe. Unfortunately, Jose Rizal's hack of his memory banks has lead to the slow degradation of the unit's communication functions.

### 2.4.11 – Teresa Magbanua

Chief production officer of narcotics to the Katipuneros. As a prototype, she served on the frontlines as an organic soldier substitute. She is getting cabin fever from the lockdown and is, therefore, taking the lead in the investigation into this killing spree.
