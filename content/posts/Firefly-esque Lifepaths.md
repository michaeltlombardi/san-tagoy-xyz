Basically a rip from [Wanton Pinoy Spaghetti](../games/wanton-pinoy-spaghetti/lifepaths.md). This is reflavored from historical Spaghetti Westerns to sci-fi Spaghetti Westerns hence the title above.

Firefly the TV series is still fun despite me not really liking the creator that much anymore. I do want to run an open table in a similar 'Verse with Browncoats and space cowboys galore!

I'll be making the Gear section next so stay tuned for that one.

UPDATE: I think I'll call this Firefly-esque thing Dark Matter Drifter for lack of a better title.

## Basic Assumptions

**Your character begins at 18 years of age**, untrained and inexperienced. By the end of character creation, you're assumed to have either retired from your career in pursuit of other goals or began traveling while still practicing your preferred profession.

Each **Skill** adds a +2 or +4 to a 1d20 roll. You only roll a 1d20 when doing something risky like shooting a foe in a firefight or trying to pick a lock under duress. The number you need to beat is often between 10 and 15. It’s a 16+ when in a Firefight and a contested roll during melee.

At times you roll with **Edge or Slack** which is rolling two d20s and taking the highest or lowest, respectively.

Apply multiple Skills to a single roll if applicable.

## Social Stratification

Roll 2d6 to determine your starting Social Status. Record the number and starting statement.

| **2d6** | **Social Status**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2--7    | **Never invited to dinner parties.** Your family falls under any of these types: (A) those who have never had wealth, (B) those who've lost wealth, and (C) exempt from the state. The game is rigged and you were not permitted to rise above your station. |
| 8--10   | **Enforcers of the illusion.** Your family was either luckily chosen to become of means or they've had a history of sustaining the status quo. Traditionally Petit Bourgeois educated enough to think they should lead the boat-rocking.                     |
| 11--12  | **Disturbingly rich.** An inherited silver spoon since generations prior and henceforth—effectively entrenched landlords.                                                                                                                                    |

## Fluent Languages

You are fluent in 1d4 languages. If you lack the native tongue of the starting region, presume you at least know the language functionally enough to survive.

Roll or choose from below. These are the common languages of the speculated future. There are no doubt more not on the list. Add whatever's not on the list.

| **1d4** | **Languages** |
| :-----: | ------------- |
|    1    | Mandarin      |
|    2    | US English    |
|    3    | LATAM Spanish |
|    4    | Hindi         |

## Choose a Service

To gain skills and acquire resources before adventuring, you must enroll in a Service. There are five to choose from:

- Drifter—amoral vagabonds with a mercenary outlook on life.
- Outlaw—unfortunate souls with the law on their scent.
- Soldier—professional fighters for and rigid enforcers of the state.
- Tradesman—individuals specialized in a craft or expertise (e.g. doctors, engineers, architects, artisans, craftsmen, etc.)
- Scion—lucky ones who were born into wealth.
- Merchant—rigorous acquirer of riches through travel.

You can enroll in a Service multiple times. **Each enrollment advancing your age by 4 years**. Each term of Service permits you to roll on the Skills Table. Each result is a rank in a Skill. You may only enroll 8 times before you must retire.

**Enrolling into a different Service** after each term is possible, but requires a different target result to be accepted. Always roll for the Service Change enrollment target even if the Service was taken at an earlier term.

### Enrollment

Roll 2d6 to determine whether you succeed enrolling into your Service of choice. Roll +1 if you're social standing is 11+. Failing the enrollment subsequently forces you to roll for your Draft, where the Service chooses you. Roll 1d6 and the result is your service for the term.

On the enrollment roll, you must also meet the minimum amount required to survive. Lower than the target means death—generate a new character.

Rolling high enough on enrollment also means you've served with Distinction and receive additional benefits. However, a roll of 12+ mandates an immediate second term in that same Service.

|                | **Drifter** | **Merchant** | **Outlaw** | **Scion** | **Soldier** | **Tradesman** |
| :------------: | :---------: | :----------: | :--------: | :-------: | :---------: | :-----------: |
|   Enrollment   |     4+      |      4+      |     3+     |    10+    |     6+      |      5+       |
|     Draft      |      1      |      2       |     3      |     4     |      5      |       6       |
|    Survival    |     4+      |      4+      |     5+     |    3+     |     7+      |      3+       |
|  Distinction   |     6+      |      7+      |     7+     |    11+    |     8+      |      6+       |
| Service Change |     5+      |      3+      |     4+     |    12+    |     4+      |      4+       |

Any time you finish your term of service, you may **Muster Out** and choose a benefit.

### Mustering Out

Whenever you end a term, Muster Out and roll once on either the Benefits Table or the Cash Table. Serving with Distinction grants an additional roll on either table.

### Skills

Whenever you roll on the Skills Table, roll only on the Service of your current term.

| **Criteria**            | **Permissible number of Skills Table rolls** |
| ----------------------- | :------------------------------------------: |
| Initial term of service |                      2                       |
| Subsequent terms        |                      1                       |
| Distinction             |                      2                       |
| Mustering Out†          |                      2                       |

_†Applies only if the benefit is rolled._

All Skills on the table can only be acquired twice. The second time raises the Skill's modifier to +4. Re-roll freely should you roll the same Skill more than twice.

## Starting Boons

Once you retire, roll for a Boon. Your social status determines your starting Boon.

| **Social Status** | **Number of Boon(s)** |
| :---------------: | :-------------------: |
|        2–7        |           1           |
|       8–10        |          1d2          |
|       11–12       |          1d4          |

Roll or choose from below.

| **1d8** | **Boons**                                          |
| :-----: | -------------------------------------------------- |
|    1    | roll on the Skills Table under Tradesman           |
|    2    | gain Athletics or Shooting                         |
|    3    | gain Fisticuffs or Weapon Fighting                 |
|    4    | start with reactive armor or a vacc suit           |
|    5    | start with a gun or a medical kit                  |
|    6    | carry valuable cargo worth 1d100 x 100             |
|    7    | inherit 5d12 x 10 credits                          |
|    8    | inherit a ship worth 100000nc or less without debt |

## Starting Inventory

When you finish character creation, you begin adventuring. Purchase your starting equipment. Prices are listed in the [Gear section](dark-matter-drifter-gear.md).

You have 12 Inventory slots. First 6 are quick slots, anything you can pull out at a moment's notice. These could be things in your pockets, belt, bandolier, coat, or hung on your back. The next 6 require 8 seconds or more to pull out from your caryall.

## Luck

Spend **Luck** points to add to 1d20 rolls. You may also **spend Luck to have things go your way**, if possible.

Roll 1d6 at the start of every session. You start with that many Luck points.

## Aging

As you age, both during character creation and after, your potential Luck reduces.

A negative modifier to your starting Luck rolls is applied at age 38 and periodically increases following the rubric below.

| **Age** | **Total Luck Modifier** |
| :-----: | :---------------------: |
|   38    |           -1            |
|   50    |           -2            |
|   58    |           -4            |
|   70    |           -6            |

## Last Steps

Don't forget about a name. If you'd like to start with a ship without paying for it immediately, go into debt. It must be paid off within 100 months with 1d8% interest.
